After I finished the first try logic, I had trouble with time limit exceed, but searching for the results, I knew that I was right, just doing something that is heavy to handle.

Then I created the refactored file removing some heavy operations (like copying arrays, and interate through all numbers instead through those who passed in the first kill)

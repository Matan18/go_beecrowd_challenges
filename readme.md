# Go Studies beecrowd

My intentions in this repo is to implement my studies with [Go language](https://go.dev/) using [beecrowd challanges](https://www.beecrowd.com.br).

Each folder must contain:

- The folder name is the challenge code number;
- A module file to represents the implementation code;
- A test file to validate possibilities;
